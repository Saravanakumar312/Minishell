# Minishell (msh)

## Description
Minishell (msh) is a minimalistic shell implemented in C, designed to explore essential Linux system programming concepts. This project covers custom command prompts, command execution, process management, job control, signal handling, and inter-process communication using pipes.

## Features
- **Customizable Command Prompt:** 
  - Default prompt: `msh>`
  - Customizable using the environment variable `PS1`.
  
- **Command Execution:**
  - Supports both internal and external commands.
  - Handles background processes with `&` and built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`.
  
- **Process Management:**
  - Foreground and background process handling.
  - Job control commands: `fg`, `bg`, `jobs`.
  
- **Signal Handling:**
  - `Ctrl+C` to send SIGINT.
  - `Ctrl+Z` to send SIGTSTP.
  
- **Pipe Functionality:**
  - Supports piping between multiple processes (e.g., `ls | grep txt | wc -l`).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Minishell.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Minishell
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage
- Run the shell:
  ```bash
  ./msh
  ```
- Start entering commands at the `msh>` prompt.

## Example Commands
- Running a command:
  ```bash
  msh> ls -l
  ```
- Customizing the prompt:
  ```bash
  msh> PS1="MyShell>"
  ```
- Running a background process:
  ```bash
  msh> sleep 30 &
  ```
- Using pipes:
  ```bash
  msh> ls | grep .c | wc -l
  ```
